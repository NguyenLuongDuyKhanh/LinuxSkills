# Files archiving

A tar file (short for tape archive) in Linux is a type of compressed or uncompressed file that consolidates multiple files and directories into a single file for easier storage, backup, or sharing.
Archiving, Not Compression: The tar command itself doesn't compress files; it just bundles them together. For compression, itâ€™s often combined with tools like 
    gzip (resulting in .tar.gz or .tgz files) or 
    bzip2 (yielding .tar.bz2 files).
